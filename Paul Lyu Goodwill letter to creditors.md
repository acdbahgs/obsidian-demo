To Whom It May Concern:

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it weren’t for my long divorce settlement process combined with being laid off from my job during the years 2013 - 2015 and beyond, I’d have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind during those time because I had to pay for two households while I was laid off from my job. 

I now have had a full job for a few years and I would like to start a regular payment plan starting with a modest monthly amount which I plan to increase the amount after a year or so. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope you’ll approve my request.

Best,

[your name]
