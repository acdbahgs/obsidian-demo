To proceed, you must provide documentation covering each account that displays good faith in rectifying the balances. Accepted documentation includes proof of payment toward debt, completed payoff notice, court documents, notice from lawyer handling accounts, correspondence with creditors, or any other documentation that supports your efforts in managing these debts.

Keep in mind background checks are time sensitive. The requested documentation should be forwarded directly to me at this email address no later than, **Monday, November 28, 2022**.
