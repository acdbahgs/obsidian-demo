## Hello Caitlin, Welsh

Hi Caitlin,

I just submitted the Background information through the keypoint portal. As you will see, my financial record has a lot due to the difficult divorce I went through while being unemployed during that period.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need and I will follow up.

Thank you.

paul
