Hi Caitlin,

I contacted MBFS (Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, 866-652-2523) and spoke to Miguel. I explained my intention to start paying off what is owed by starting with a modest monthly payment with the goal of increasing the amount in about a year. The conversation was recorded and Miguel updated my file in the system.

He explained what I should do to start this process of promise-to-pay

**Creditor**

**Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS)** account#: 70037-0-9999-001, balance: $7882, Monthly: $30, start date: Wed. 11/30/2022

              Steps

1.  Make the check payable to Mercedes-Benz Financial Services with full account number written on check
2.  Mail it to **Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, P.O. Box 5209, Carol Stream IL 60197-5209 with acct# 70037-0-9999-001**
3.  **After 7-10 days, call MBFS at 866-652-2523** and get **confirmation on the receipt of the check** and **ask for the remaining balance**.

In summary, here are the 5 creditors with whom I have made a promise-to-pay arrangements:

1.  Chase account: **4071-6621-0723-3903** , balance: $10,120, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**
2.  Chase account: **4147-2021-2352-3712** , balance: $8,681.41, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**
3.  Chase account: **4147-4001-4018-1122** , balance: $9,325.54, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**
4.  Chase account: **4320-1610-0518-2592** , balance: $17,437, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**
5.  MBFS account: **70037-0-9999-001**, balance: $7882, Monthly: $30, **start date: Wed. 11/30/2022**

Please let me know if you any questions or comments.

Have a great Holiday!

Thank you.

Hi Caitlin,

I was able to get in touch with the creditors at Chase bank and agree on a **promise-to-pay plan on 4 Chase bank accounts** today, Tuesday 11/22/2022. I spoke to **Mr. Q (Chase Employee-id: M245510) by calling the number, 866-403-8895** and **committed to paying $25/month  for each delinquent account with the goal of increasing the monthly amount after a year (after 11/21/2023)** . 

I will make payments to the 4 Chase account starting **at the end of this month, Wednesday 11/30/2022** . I will **make the payments at a local Chase bank** branch office where I will present my driver's license and fill out deposit slips for each account and **get the transaction receipts for each account.** Then **I will email them to you/FRBNY LEW as proof that I am living up to my commitment.**

Here are the 4 accounts with full account numbers and monthly amount I committed to:  
1. Chase account: **4071-6621-0723-3903** , balance: $10,120, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**  
2. Chase account: **4147-2021-2352-3712** , balance: $8,681.41, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**  
3. Chase account: **4147-4001-4018-1122** , balance: $9,325.54, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022**  
4. Chase account: **4320-1610-0518-2592** , balance: $17,437, Monthly: $25, **start date: 11/30/2022** 

I am **working on one more creditor to make a similar promise-to-pay arrangement and left them a message** . I **will keep trying!** This week a short one due to Thanksgiving, I hope someone will get back to me. I will follow up with the status shortly. 

The reason for my debt comes from a year and a half of divorce negotiation period that was settled on December of 2015 and two layoffs. Now that I have a full time job, I am going to do my best to pay back what I owe.

Thank you.
