## Did anything out of the ordinary happen today
- back to work after 5 PTO (+wednesday added)
- TAG63 PreQA testing
- Deply TAG63 to INT1: post deployment steps?
- OPICS questions
- [ ] automatic DNS change: NPQS DNS switch - still manual - for this BRT (1)we will manually switch DNS (2) we open 2 KSRs: 1 for app server 1 for db server
- [ ] non unplanned switch: we don't have to inform customer
- [ ] if non planned - consumers would have switched so we just send and FYI. We **don't have to** wait for consumers to do something before we can do anything. 
- [ ] we publish bmk from CC3 at 3:30
- [ ] next day OPICS comes in the next day to pick up: this is the edge case where we will have to re-distribute or manually copy the file
- [ ] 1 NPQS SPECPOOL tables
- [ ] 2 Offer sheets from IMGR: get a shared drive mounted where on a weekly basis, they will drop off offer sheets and we load into table (in dev in October would be great)
- [ ] 
- [ ] 3 TSAR data: CSV data that comes in from TSAR we load
- [ ] Need service id to do this
