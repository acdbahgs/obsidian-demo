Hi Caitlin,

I was able to get in touch with the creditors at Chase bank and agree on a promise-to-pay plan on 4 Chase bank accounts today, Tuesday 11/22/2022. I spoke to Mr. Q (Chase Employee-id: M245510) by calling the number, 866-403-8895 and committed to paying $25/month  for each delinquent account with the goal of increasing the monthly amount after a year (after 11/21/2023). 

I will make payments to the 4 Chase account starting at the end of this month, Wednesday 11/30/2022. I will make the payments at a local Chase bank branch office where I will present my driver's license and fill out deposit slips for each account and get the transaction receipts for each account. Then I will email them to you/FRBNY LEW as proof that I am living up to my committment.

Here are the 4 accounts with full account numbers and monthly amount I committed to:
1. Chase account: 4071-6621-0723-3903, balance: $10,120, Monthly: $25, start date: 11/30/2022
2. Chase account: 4147-2021-2352-3712, balance: $8,681.41, Monthly: $25, start date: 11/30/2022
3. Chase account: 4147-4001-4018-1122, balance: $9,325.54, Monthly: $25, start date: 11/30/2022
4. Chase account: 4320-1610-0518-2592, balance: $17,437, Monthly: $25, start date: 11/30/2022
